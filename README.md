# Simon-game
 Project Name: Simon Game (Color Sequence Memory Game) Description: Developed an interactive memory-based Simon Game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game generates a sequence of colors that the player must replicate in order. Features include:
Dynamic level progression as the player's memory sequence matches the game's.
High score tracking to encourage user engagement.
Smooth visual effects, including flashing color buttons for both system-generated and user-input sequences.
Game-over handling with a restart option, providing a seamless user experience.
This project demonstrates skills in DOM manipulation, event handling, and JavaScript logic to create an engaging browser-based game.
